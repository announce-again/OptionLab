# Stage 3.2 Completion Summary

Stage 3.2 consumes Stage 3.1 `ImpliedVolatilityChain` output and completes the
following immutable analysis path:

```text
IV observations
-> selected expiry smiles
-> ATM/skew/curvature
-> signed-delta IV
-> RR/BF
-> expiry term structures
-> deterministic exports
```

It does not construct or interpolate a volatility surface.

## Run

From the repository root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -B examples\market_data\11_stage_3_2_volatility_smiles.py --rows 50000 --output-dir .tmp\examples_output\volatility_smiles
```

The normal suite excludes the registered `large` marker. Run the 50k smoke test
separately:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -B -m pytest -m large tests\test_volatility_pipeline_large.py --basetemp=.tmp\pytest-large -p no:cacheprovider -vv
```

## Observed 50,000-Row Conservation

Observed on 2026-08-02 with the commands above:

```text
input rows                         50,000
Stage 3.1 IV quotes               49,985
selected smile points             24,990
excluded IV quotes                24,995
smiles                               500
local metric results                 500
delta metric aggregates              500
term structures                       100
term-structure expiry points           500
```

The selection accounting identity is:

```text
49,985 IV quotes = 24,990 selected points + 24,995 excluded quotes
```

Every smile produced one local result, one aggregate delta result, and one term
structure point. No failed row or metric was silently dropped.

## Observed Metric Outcomes

```text
metric             success  failure
ATM                    500        0
skew                   500        0
curvature              500        0
25-delta call           500        0
25-delta put            500        0
RR25                    500        0
BF25                    500        0
```

Other inputs are not required to achieve all-success outcomes. Failures remain in
the same result and export tables with machine-readable reasons.

## Observed Throughput

```text
pipeline                              5,276 input rows/second
smile selection                      37,124 IV quotes/second
local metrics                         6,274 smiles/second
delta metrics                         4,742 smiles/second
term-structure assembly             287,704 expiry results/second
generation-to-export                  3,483 input rows/second
```

`pipeline` throughput covers ingestion through Stage 3.1 IV construction and is
reported by `VolatilityPipelineResult`. `generation-to-export` starts before
synthetic CSV generation and ends after all Stage 3.2 exports. These rates have
different boundaries and must not be compared as the same benchmark. All values
are development-machine observations, not service-level guarantees.

## Deterministic Export Hashes

```text
smile_metrics.csv       283fb1052ab9805b86d85acfecf5754026e07c0feece1b0901783d404ac90295

```

The large test writes each analysis export twice and requires identical records,
bytes, and SHA-256 values. It also reruns aggregate analysis with reversed smile
input and requires identical delta and term-structure records.

## Next Stage

Stage 3.2 is complete. The next roadmap item is Stage 3.3 - Non-Parametric
Volatility Surface. No Stage 3.3 implementation is included in this work.
