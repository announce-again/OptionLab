# NCX Derivatives Roadmap

NCX Derivatives is a from-scratch quantitative derivatives research and market-making platform.

The project is designed to progress from mathematically transparent pricing models to a modular research, risk, and electronic market-making system. Each stage should produce a usable, tested component rather than a collection of disconnected notebooks.

---

## Engineering Principles

Development follows several core principles:

- Mathematical correctness before optimisation
- Explicit assumptions and unit conventions
- Stable, documented public APIs
- Analytical results validated against numerical methods
- Numerical methods validated through convergence and invariants
- Input validation and well-defined boundary behaviour
- Reproducible research workflows
- Automated testing for every production-facing component
- Separation between reusable library code and exploratory research
- Incremental commits organised around complete milestones

The standard development cycle is:

```text
Design
→ Implement
→ Test
→ Validate
→ Document
→ Commit
```

- Whether volume is interval, session, previous-session, or otherwise
  aggregated
- Whether exchange-like fields mean listing exchange, quote venue, trade venue,
  publisher, or dataset

move through explicit reconnaissance checkpoints:

avoid splitting the roadmap too early.

### Status

**Planned**

---

## Stage 2.8 — Static-Arbitrage Diagnostics

- Memory reduction
- Parallel simulation
- Caching
- Optional NumPy or compiled backends
- Benchmark tracking

## Reproducibility

- Fixed random seeds where appropriate

# Near-Term Priorities

The immediate development sequence is:

1. Begin Stage 2.4 — Normalisation
2. Build rates, dividends, and forwards
3. Build chain-wide implied-volatility workflows

The project should not advance to complex volatility or market-making research until the foundational numerical methods are independently validated.

---

# Definition of Project Success

NCX Derivatives will be considered successful when it can:

- Price standard European and American derivatives using multiple methods
- Recover and analyse implied volatility from market quotes
- Construct and diagnose volatility smiles and surfaces
- Represent and value multi-leg portfolios
- Explain portfolio P&L through risk sensitivities
- Simulate a market maker that quotes, trades, hedges, and controls inventory
- Produce reproducible quantitative research supported by documented assumptions and automated tests

The final objective is not to reproduce the infrastructure of a full trading firm. It is to build a transparent, technically rigorous miniature derivatives research and market-making stack that demonstrates the mathematical, engineering, and decision-making foundations behind professional options trading.
